/*
Start this accessibility journey by providing a lang attribute to your html element. This will assist screen readers in identifying the language of the page.

You may be familiar with the meta element already; it is used to specify information about the page, such as the title, description, keywords, and author.

The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and, nowadays, UTF-8 is the only encoding supported by most browsers.


Continuing with the meta elements, a viewport definition tells the browser how to render the page. Including one betters visual accessibility on mobile, and improves SEO (search engine optimization).
Another important meta element for accessibility and SEO is the description definition. The value of the content attribute is used by search engines to provide a description of your page.
