Start this accessibility journey by providing a lang attribute to your html element. This will assist screen readers in identifying the language of the page.

You may be familiar with the meta element already; it is used to specify information about the page, such as the title, description, keywords, and author.

The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and, nowadays, UTF-8 is the only encoding supported by most browsers.


Continuing with the meta elements, a viewport definition tells the browser how to render the page. Including one betters visual accessibility on mobile, and improves SEO (search engine optimization).
Another important meta element for accessibility and SEO is the description definition. The value of the content attribute is used by search engines to provide a description of your page.


Navigation is a core part of accessibility, and screen readers rely on you to provide the structure of your page. This is accomplished with semantic HTML elements.

Add a header and a main element to your page.



The header element will be used to introduce the page, as well as provide a navigation menu.

The main element will contain the core content of your page.



A useful property of an SVG (scalable vector graphics) is that it contains a path attribute which allows the image to be scaled without affecting the resolution of the resultant image.

 To increase the page accessibility, the role attribute can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element on the page to assistive technologies. The role attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), and accepts preset values.




 Every region role requires a visible label, which should be referenced by the aria-labelledby attribute.



 Typeface plays an important role in the accessibility of a page. Some fonts are easier to read than others, and this is especially true on low-resolution screens.-->
